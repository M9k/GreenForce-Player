GreenForce-Player is an alternative player to play video and audio media. A special feature is that it allows to password protect video and audio files. 
It is specifically designed for reducing the hard drive access by using a cache system to extend the battery life of laptops. 
In addition, the player supports the ability to encrypt media files to protect them with a password from unauthorized access.

Bug reports and suggestions are very welcome.
